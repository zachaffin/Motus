# Mōtus

Mōtus is a physics-based space adventure/puzzle game. Take on the role of an astronaut, thrown from their ship and left adrift in space after surviving a disastrous collision, and make your way through asteroids, debris, and other obstacles.

Your jetpack is critically low on fuel, but that's not the only tool you have. Use your gravity-manipulating Black Hole Gun to create...black holes!

Point and right click (two finger press on mobile) anywhere in space and watch a small, completely not-to-scale ball of unimaginable mass grow seemingly from nothing and begin to pull objects, including you, inward towards certain destruction.

Beat each level with as few bursts from your jetpack as possible by slingshotting yourself around your little, dense friends, and keep an eye out for other opportunities to be fuel-efficient. Your score depends on it!

# Programmed in C#

  - Makes use of the Singleton and Observer patterns
  - Avoids tightly coupled classes with the help of events

# Built with Unity
- Simulates gravity from as many black holes as you can survive placing!
- Coroutines enable code to run over several frames and in parallel

# Controls:

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

# Disclaimers
- I am not an artist in any way shape or form. Much of the game uses placeholder geometry (you play as a sphere not an astronaut) for this reason
- This project was for fun and for learning aspects of C#, features of the Unity engine, design patterns, etc.
- I can think of several improvements to make to this code, but school and work are priorities, and while I've done some profiling and tried out different approaches, it was always done as an excercise, not simply to create the most perfect and performant build
